## Background:

By now all of you have collected some experience in writing an R package. How did that go? What were the difficulties? Have you got a story to share about a CRAN submission that went particularly well (or not)?

Write a blog post on your experience. 

## Instructions:
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
