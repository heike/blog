## My Example: define a new S3 class with objects and methods

Firstly, you want to creat an object about the midterm score of a student. Then you asssign it to a class named "student".
```{r}
midterm <- list(name = "Rachel", score = 97, lettergrade = "A")
class(midterm)

class(midterm) <- append(class(midterm),"student")
class(midterm)
```

Secondly, you may define the method to get the information of the student's letter grade.
```{r}
letter_grade <- function(x)
 {
     UseMethod("letter_grade",x)
 }

 letter_grade <- function(x)
 {
    return(c(x$lettergrade))
 }

letter_grade(midterm)

```
