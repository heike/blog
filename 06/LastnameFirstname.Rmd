## Background:

Read through the chapter on [Functional Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html) of Hadley Wickham's book on *Advanced R Programming*.

Write a blog post discussing the question:

Regard the code below and describe in what way(s) the idea of functional programming makes code easier to write and maintain.

```
x <- 1:10
funs <- list(
  sum = sum,
  mean = mean,
  median = median
)
lapply(funs, function(f) f(x, na.rm=TRUE))
```



## Instructions:
Save a **copy** of this file, replacing "Lastname" and "Firstname" with your own and *leave the original unedited*.

In **your copy**, replace the `title:` and `author:` fields in the YAML above, while leaving the remaining fields intact. Remove the background and the instructions sections and write your blog post!

Once you are done, **create a pull request** to upload your changes to the original repository!
